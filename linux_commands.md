## üóÇÔ∏è Ubuntu Directory Structure

Ubuntu (and Linux in general) follows a **hierarchical directory structure**. Here's an overview of important directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory. Everything starts here. |
| `/home` | User directories (`/home/username`). |
| `/bin` | Essential binary executables (e.g., `ls`, `cat`). |
| `/sbin` | System binaries (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`). |
| `/usr` | User-installed software and libraries. |
| `/var` | Variable data files (logs, cache, spool). |
| `/etc` | Configuration files for the system. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files. Cleared on reboot. |
| `/opt` | Optional software (e.g., third-party apps). |
| `/lib` | Essential shared libraries. |
| `/proc` | Virtual filesystem for process information. |
| `/dev` | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disk). |
| `/boot` | Bootloader files (e.g., kernel). |
| `/mnt` & `/media` | Mount points for temporary/media devices. |
