### **1. Difference Between TCP and UDP**

| Feature               | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**                         | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**                        |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection**        | Connection-oriented protocol. Requires establishing a connection before data transfer. | Connectionless protocol. No need for a connection.     |
| **Reliability**       | Reliable data delivery. Ensures data is received in the correct order. | Unreliable. Data may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order. |
| **Error Checking**    | Built-in error checking and correction mechanisms.              | Error checking is optional. No error correction.        |
| **Speed**             | Slower due to overhead (connection establishment, retransmissions). | Faster, with less overhead.                             |
| **Use Cases**         | File transfers, web browsing, email (where reliability is crucial). | Streaming, online gaming, voice calls (where speed is prioritized). |
| **Example**           | HTTP, FTP, SMTP                                                | DNS, DHCP, VoIP, online video streaming                 |

### **2. Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture**

| Feature               | **Microservices Architecture**                                 | **Monolithic Architecture**                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Size and Complexity**| A large application broken into small, independent services.   | A single, unified codebase with all functionalities.      |
| **Development and Deployment** | Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. | Development, testing, and deployment happen as one unit. |
| **Scalability**        | Scalable at the service level. Each microservice can scale independently. | Scalability is limited to the entire application.         |
| **Flexibility**        | More flexible; different services can use different technologies. | Less flexible; typically uses one stack for everything.   |
| **Resilience**         | Fault isolation; one service failure doesn't bring the whole system down. | A failure in one part can impact the entire system.       |

### **3. SQL vs NoSQL Databases**

| Feature               | **SQL Databases**                                               | **NoSQL Databases**                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**     | Structured data with predefined schemas (tables, rows).        | Semi-structured or unstructured data (key-value, document, graph). |
| **Scalability**        | Vertical scaling (adding more power to the existing machine).   | Horizontal scaling (adding more nodes to the system).      |
| **ACID Compliance**    | Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. | May support only eventual consistency or relaxed ACID compliance. |
| **Use Cases**          | Suitable for transactional applications (banking, accounting). | Suitable for large-scale, high-throughput applications (big data, social media). |
| **Examples**           | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                                      | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis                                  |

### **4. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication**

| Feature               | **Synchronous Communication**                                | **Asynchronous Communication**                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blocking**           | The sender waits for a response before continuing.           | The sender doesn't wait for a response and continues.    |
| **Use Case**           | Suitable for real-time applications (e.g., phone calls).     | Suitable for systems that don't require immediate feedback (e.g., email). |
| **Example**            | HTTP request-response, RPC calls.                            | Message queues, event-driven systems.                    |
| **Performance**        | Can lead to slower performance due to blocking calls.        | Generally better performance due to non-blocking nature. |
| **Error Handling**     | Can handle errors in real-time.                              | Requires mechanisms like retries or callbacks.           |

### **5. REST vs GraphQL**

| Feature               | **REST (Representational State Transfer)**                   | **GraphQL**                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**      | Fixed endpoints for specific resources.                      | Flexible, clients can request exactly the data they need. |
| **Over-fetching/Under-fetching** | Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching of data.      | No over-fetching or under-fetching; fetch only necessary data. |
| **Efficiency**         | Multiple round trips to different endpoints may be required. | Single query can fetch data from multiple resources.      |
| **Versioning**         | Requires versioning of APIs (v1, v2, etc.).                  | No versioning needed, clients can request the required fields. |
| **Example Use Cases**  | CRUD operations in traditional applications.                | Dynamic front-end applications (e.g., React, mobile apps). |

### **6. Load Balancer vs API Gateway**

| Feature               | **Load Balancer**                                             | **API Gateway**                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. | Acts as a centralized entry point for API requests, handles routing, security, etc. |
| **Primary Role**       | Balances traffic to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.   | Manages API requests, enforces security, throttling, and load balancing. |
| **Use Cases**          | Distributing web traffic, ensuring high availability.        | Routing API calls, aggregating responses from different services. |
| **Example**            | Nginx, HAProxy                                               | Kong, AWS API Gateway                                    |

### **7. Stateful vs Stateless Services**

| Feature               | **Stateful Service**                                         | **Stateless Service**                                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **State Preservation** | Maintains session or state information across requests.       | Does not retain state between requests.                   |
| **Scalability**        | Difficult to scale due to state dependency.                  | Easily scalable, as each request is independent.          |
| **Failover Handling**  | Requires careful failover strategies to preserve state.      | Failover is easier because the service doesn’t rely on any stored state. |
| **Use Case**           | Shopping carts, user sessions.                              | REST APIs, microservices.                                 |

### **8. Horizontal Scaling vs Vertical Scaling**

| Feature               | **Horizontal Scaling**                                       | **Vertical Scaling**                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Adding more machines (or nodes) to distribute the load.       | Adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single machine.       |
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable, but requires distributed systems management. | Limited scalability; once the server’s capacity is reached, it can't scale further. |
| **Cost**               | Can be more cost-effective for large-scale applications.      | Can become expensive as resources on a single machine grow.  |
| **Use Case**           | Cloud environments, microservices, distributed systems.      | Small systems, single-instance applications.                |

### **9. Traditional Server vs Serverless Computing**

| Feature               | **Traditional Server**                                      | **Serverless Computing**                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Management**         | Requires manual provisioning and scaling of servers.         | No server management; the cloud provider handles infrastructure. |
| **Scalability**        | Limited to the capacity of the hardware, must be scaled manually. | Automatically scales with demand.                          |
| **Cost**               | Pay for the server resources used, regardless of usage.      | Pay-per-use, only for the resources consumed during execution. |
| **Use Case**           | Long-running services, databases.                           | Event-driven functions, microservices.                      |
