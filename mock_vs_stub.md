I understand that you're looking for a more **practical explanation** of **mocks** and **stubs**, so let's break it down with simple and clear examples in a way that will help you understand **when and how to use them**.

### **Difference Between Mocks and Stubs:**

#### **1. Stubs:**
A **stub** is a simple method that is used to **replace a method** or function in your code, **returning a fixed value** (without real implementation) for the purpose of **unit testing**. It's used to simulate the behavior of a dependency in your tests.

- **Purpose**: **Isolate** the unit under test by providing simple, predefined behavior for external dependencies.
- **Behavior**: It **doesn’t care** about the interactions or the number of times a method is called. It just returns a predefined value.

#### **2. Mocks:**
A **mock** is more powerful and typically **tracks method calls**, allowing you to **verify** if the correct methods were called with the expected parameters and the correct number of calls. Mocks are used to **check behavior** in your tests.

- **Purpose**: **Verify** interactions between the unit under test and its dependencies.
- **Behavior**: Mocks can **track** how many times a function was called, with what arguments, and even assert whether it was called at all.

### **Example: Understanding the Difference in Code**

#### **Scenario**:
Let’s say we have a function that fetches some data from a database. We want to test a service function that uses this method, but we don’t want to hit the actual database in our tests.

### **Stub Example**:
The stub will **return a fixed value** for the method, ignoring how it’s called.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"testing"
)

// Service that interacts with the database
type Database interface {
	GetUser(id int) string
}

type Service struct {
	db Database
}

func (s *Service) GetUserInfo(id int) string {
	return s.db.GetUser(id) // We are calling the GetUser method of the db
}

// Stub for Database interface
type StubDatabase struct{}

func (s *StubDatabase) GetUser(id int) string {
	return "User: John Doe" // Always returns the same value, ignoring the input
}

func TestGetUserInfo(t *testing.T) {
	// Using the StubDatabase for testing
	stub := &StubDatabase{}
	service := &Service{db: stub}

	result := service.GetUserInfo(1)
	expected := "User: John Doe"
	if result != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %s, but got %s", expected, result)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Run the test manually (In actual code, `go test` will run this)
	TestGetUserInfo(nil)
}
```

- **What is happening?**
  - The **stub** (`StubDatabase`) simply returns the same result ("User: John Doe") no matter what.
  - We're **isolating** the `Service` from the real database.
  - The **test** doesn't care how many times `GetUser` is called, just that it returns the expected result.

- **Purpose of Stub**: The stub **isolates** the method call to `GetUser`, so we can test `Service.GetUserInfo` without worrying about the actual database logic.

### **Mock Example**:
A **mock** would be more detailed, checking **if the method is called** and **how many times** it is called, with the correct parameters.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"testing"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

// Service that interacts with the database
type Database interface {
	GetUser(id int) string
}

type Service struct {
	db Database
}

func (s *Service) GetUserInfo(id int) string {
	return s.db.GetUser(id)
}

// Mock for Database interface
type MockDatabase struct {
	mock.Mock
}

func (m *MockDatabase) GetUser(id int) string {
	args := m.Called(id) // Capture the argument passed to the method
	return args.String(0) // Return the mock response
}

func TestGetUserInfoWithMock(t *testing.T) {
	// Create a new mock
	mockDB := new(MockDatabase)
	service := &Service{db: mockDB}

	// Setup expectations (we expect GetUser to be called with the argument 1)
	mockDB.On("GetUser", 1).Return("User: John Doe")

	// Call the method under test
	result := service.GetUserInfo(1)

	// Assert the expectations
	mockDB.AssertExpectations(t)

	// Validate the result
	expected := "User: John Doe"
	if result != expected {
		t.Errorf("Expected %s, but got %s", expected, result)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Run the test manually (In actual code, `go test` will run this)
	TestGetUserInfoWithMock(nil)
}
```

- **What is happening?**
  - The **mock** (`MockDatabase`) expects that `GetUser` will be called with the argument `1` and will return `"User: John Doe"`.
  - We **assert** that the mock was called correctly using `mockDB.AssertExpectations(t)`.
  - If the method was **not called as expected** (e.g., with the wrong parameters or number of times), the test would fail.

- **Purpose of Mock**: The mock **verifies behavior**. It checks that `GetUser` was called with the correct parameter (`1`) and that it returns the expected result. It ensures the interaction between the service and the database is as expected.

### **Key Differences Between Mocks and Stubs**:

| **Aspect**         | **Stub**                                                | **Mock**                                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Simulate a simple behavior and isolate code.            | Track interactions (e.g., calls, arguments) and verify behavior. |
| **Return Values**  | Always returns a predefined value.                      | Returns predefined values, but also tracks calls and arguments. |
| **Behavior**       | Doesn’t check if methods are called correctly.          | Verifies if methods were called with correct arguments, count, and order. |
| **Use Case**       | Isolating external dependencies for testing.            | Ensuring correct **interaction** between objects (how and when methods are called). |
| **Example**        | Returning a fixed response in a unit test (e.g., fixed DB response). | Ensuring that a method is called with the expected argument. |

---

### **Summary:**
- **Stubs**: Used to **isolate** a unit of work from external dependencies, simply returning predefined values. They are **passive** in the test and do not track interactions.
- **Mocks**: Used to **verify interactions** between components. They track how and when a method is called and can assert that the expected behavior occurs. Mocks are **active** and enforce that certain interactions happen.

In general:
- **Use Stubs** when you need simple replacements for methods that return data but don't need to track behavior.
- **Use Mocks** when you need to verify that certain methods were called, and you care about the **interaction** between your unit and its dependencies.
